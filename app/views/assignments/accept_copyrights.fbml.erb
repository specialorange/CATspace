<h2>Copyrights Policy</h2>
<p><strong>CATspace</strong> We respect the intellectual property rights of others and we prohibit users from uploading, posting or otherwise transmitting through any application or website offered by us any materials that violate another party's intellectual property rights. When we receive proper Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement as described below, we promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

<h3>A. Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement</h3>

<p>1.  Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work or intellectual property that you claim has been infringed so that we can locate the material. For example, "The copyrighted work is my content that appears at http://apps.facebook.com/catspace/assignments/item." If multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by your Notification, you may provide a representative list of such works at that site. </p>
<p>2.  Identify the URL or other specific location on the application or website provided by us that contains the material that you claim infringes your copyright described in Item 1 above.

<p>3.  Provide the electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf. </p>
<p>4.  Include a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. </p>
